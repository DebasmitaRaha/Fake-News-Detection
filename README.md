# Fake-News-Detection
Fake news poses a significant threat to society, influencing opinions and decisions with misleading information. This project leverages machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting—to build a robust system for detecting fake news. The project focuses on analyzing textual content to classify news as either fake or real, contributing to the fight against misinformation.

# Key Features
* Implements Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting for classification.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for data preprocessing and feature extraction.
* Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy and prevention of overfitting.

# Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
   * Cleaning and tokenizing text data.
   * Removing noise, such as punctuation and stop words.
2. Feature Extraction
3. Model Training and Testing:
   * Training Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting models.
   * Evaluating using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Result Output:
   * Classifying news articles as "Fake" or "Real" with a confidence score.

# Technologies Used
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries and Frameworks:
  * Pandas
  * Numpy
  * Scikit-Learn
  * Nltk
3. Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting

# Use Cases
* Real-time detection of fake news on social media platforms.
* Supporting journalists and fact-checkers in content verification.
* Educating users to identify and avoid misinformation.
* Enhancing content moderation for organizations.

# Results
